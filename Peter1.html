            <h4>Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019):</h4>
            <p>In December 2016, Sony Pictures announced a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming, for release on July 5, 2019.
                In June 2017, Feige stated that the film would be titled in a similar fashion to Homecoming,
                using a subtitle, and would not have a number in the title. A year later, Holland revealed the film's title as Spider-Man: Far From Home.
                Watts returned to direct, and Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Batalon, Tomei, and Revolori reprise their roles from Homecoming, with Jake Gyllenhaal joining as Quentin Beck / Mysterio.
                As in Homecoming, other characters from MCU installments reprise their roles, with Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders appearing as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, respectively.
                In April 2019, Sony Pictures moved the release date to July 2, 2019.
                Set after the events of Endgame, the film features Parker and his friends going to Europe on summer vacation,
                where Parker, intending to take a break from superheroics is drawn back to it when he is forced to team up with Fury and Mysterio in battling the Elementals.

            <h4>Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021):</h4>
            <p>In September 2019, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures announced to produce a third film,
                after an impasse between the two companies during negotiations. Watts returned to direct, from a script by McKenna and Sommers.
                Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Batalon, Tomei, and Revolori reprise their roles, and are joined by Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong in their MCU roles as Stephen Strange and Wong,
                respectively, with the events of this film tying into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022).
                The film links the pre-MCU Spider-Man films via the multiverse and features Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprise their respective roles as their versions of Spider-Man,
                while Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Thomas Haden Church reprise their roles as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus and Flint Marko / Sandman respectively from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy,
                along with Jamie Foxx and Rhys Ifans as Max Dillon / Electro and Curt Connors / Lizard respectively from Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films.
                Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series and Tom Hardy appears, uncredited, as Eddie Brock, reprising the role from Sony's Spider-Man Universe.
                After Mysterio exposes Parker's identity as Spider-Man to the world in Far From Home in addition to incriminating him for his demise, ruining Parker's and his close ones' life in the process, Parker asks Strange to make it a secret again with magic,
                but this inadvertently breaks open the multiverse and allows visitors from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe.
