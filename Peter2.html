            <h4>Spider-Man (2002):</h4>
            <p>Spider-Man follows Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), an orphaned high schooler who pines after popular girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).
                While on a science class field trip at Columbia University, a genetically-engineered "super spider" bites Peter. As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, including increased strength, speed, and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing. After his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is murdered, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battle suit, Norman becomes a freakish "Green Goblin", who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must battle with the Goblin,
                 all while dealing with personal situations involving his domestic and his love life.</p>

            <h4>Spider-Man 2 (2004):</h4>
            <p>
                Two years after the events of the first film,
                Peter struggles to balance his superhero and private lives and still pines after Mary Jane Watson,
                who is now engaged. Harry Osborn continues to believe Spider-Man is responsible for his father Norman Osborn's death.
                Spider-Man contends with scientist Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), also known as Doctor Octopus,
                who initially mentors his alter-ego and has four mechanical tentacles fused to his spine following a failed fusion-based experiment and sets out to recreate the same that could destroy much of New York City.

            <h4>Spider-Man 3 (2007):</h4>
            <p>
                Peter is still with Mary Jane Watson,
                while Harry Osborn succeeds his father as the new Green Goblin (credited as New Goblin).
                Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who, like Peter, is a photographer for the Daily Bugle,
                sets out to defame Spider-Man and incriminate him. Meanwhile,
                Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster known as Sandman.
                Peter later learns that Marko killed Uncle Ben,
                causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow.
                This vendetta is enhanced by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter,
                resulting in the formation of a new black costume.
                Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new host in the form of Brock,
                resulting in the creation of Venom and Peter Parker having to battle the villains in the end.
