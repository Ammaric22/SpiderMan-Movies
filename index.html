            <h3>About Spiderman:</h3>
            <p>The fictional character Spider-Man, a comic book superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and featured in Marvel Comics publications,
                has appeared as a main character in numerous theatrical and made-for-television films.
                Spider-Man in film dates back to 1977,
                his rights belonging to Marvel until 1999, when Sony bought them for $7 million.
                He has been Marvel's most successful character in the cinema industry ever since.
                After selling the Spider-Man motion picture rights to Sony, Marvel built its own studio, eventually developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)
                without its most renowned character. This would change in 2016,
                when Marvel finally was able to add Spider-Man to its cinematic universe, after a licensing deal between Sony and Disney.
                The agreement ended up being successful to both companies. The following two Avengers sequels, finally with Spider-Man, crossed the $2 billion mark
                at worldwide box office for the first time. Meanwhile, Sony in association with Marvel launched a new superhero universe,
                leading Sony to get in 2022 the biggest deal ever for streaming rights: a $3 billion streaming license to Netflix and Disney platforms.</p>
